As a Speech-Language Pathologist based in Northumberland, I am dedicated to working with children and helping them develop their speech and language skills. I am passionate about creating engaging and effective therapy sessions tailored to each child's unique needs. My goal is to foster communication skills in a warm and supportive environment, making a positive impact in the lives of the children I work with. :)
