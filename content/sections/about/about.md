As a Speech-Language Pathologist based in Northumberland, I am dedicated to working with children and helping them develop their speech and language skills. I am passionate about creating engaging and effective therapy sessions tailored to each child's unique needs. My goal is to foster communication skills in a warm and supportive environment, making a positive impact on the lives of the children I work with.

I provide therapy for children experiencing difficulties with speech sound production (articulation), oral language skills (vocabulary, understanding and expression of language), augmentative and alternative (AAC).
